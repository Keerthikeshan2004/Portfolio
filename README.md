# Portfolio
I'm Keerthikeshan, a passionate and curious software developer currently pursuing my undergraduate degree. I specialize in Information Technology. Iâ€™ve built projects like a Karaikal Tourism Website, an Online Course Hub, and an ML-powered Adaptive Traffic Control System using technologies such as HTML, CSS, Python, and YOLO for object detection.
